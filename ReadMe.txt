1. Files from tutorial:
Advanced Techniques in JavaScript and jQuery by Kevin Murray
Take your JavaScript functions to the next level. Explore events and learn about jQuery Deferred objects.

2. However due to CORS protection it would not work.
See attached image with error, and URL:

3. To fix it, setup your nodejs http server in order to play with it.

And open HTML file from URL:
http://127.0.0.1:8080/Deferred-Processing-1.html
Then it should work.
